Problems: the lexer has moved ahread too far and so:

JSON 
{ "abc" : "def" }
WHERE
{
  ?s ?p ?o 
}

attempts to parse WHERE in JSON more (it's a KeyString)

Use SPAQL tokens 

with a special test for ":" which is a PNAME_NS

JKeyString: 

PNAME_NS or special token
<PNAME_JSON: (<PN_PREFIX>)? (" ")+ ":" >
