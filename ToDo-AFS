SDB ToDo list (and general notes)
=================================

+ Assemblers : { :type jas:assembler "classname"  } for autoloading.
  ja:imports as well.?

+ --sdb=@ for global registration?

+ Prefixes : disable for ModelRDB only.
  Done?? Check

+ Prepared statement query cache?
  When will it be beneficial - GraphSDB and add/delete single triples?

+ Value-based hashing
  String version - and have fixed choice of xsd:string or plain string for terms.
  Partial alternative: condition is "T.o = hash1 OR T.o = hash2"

+ Features: more general config setting?
  Or really use properties?
  layout; layout/index; layout/hash for now.

+ Generating SQL:
  + Precedence-driven output for SqlExpr // SqlExprGenerateSQL, not lots of nesting.
  + SELECT/one table ==> move constraints out (it's just SPJ)
    Put in a SqlNode optimizer stage, just before generation
      IJ-R-T => IJ(r)-T is done specially 
  + Generalize linearization of InnerJoin-only trees
  + Be careful about code generation and a right complex expression
    Use a SELECT for nested expressions?  generalize from COALESCE code generation.
    
+ Features:
  In desc file for now.
  Features are params to layout

+ Values and conditions : reactivate condition compilation.
  Need value access
  Isolate QC2.insertValueGetter

+ Add query tests :
  /Structure/ { opt ... } JOIN { opt ... } 
  
+ ValueTables
  String value table
    With no URIs, much shorter.
    Full text indexing where available?

+ Graph pattern tables

+ Abstract columns types then simple templating.
        VARCHAR/TEXT/BLOB abstract syntax
