Checkup from SVN

To get the dependent jars:
   mvn dependency:resolve dependency:sources
which will use the .classpath from SVN.
It assumes you have M2_REPO set correctly.

To rebuild the .classpath file:
  mvn eclipse:eclipse \
      -DdownloadSources=true \
      -DdownloadJavadoc=false \
      -DbuildOutputDirectory=classes

then put back the src-dev source folder (code that is used for development
but is not part of the artifact itself e.g. current work items, bug
reports, ....). This sets the IDE output to "classes/" (this keep maven
builds separate from code development).
