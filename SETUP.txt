== Checkup from SVN:
  svn co https://jena.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jena/Fuseki/trunk Fuseki

== After checking out from SVN:

To get the dependent jars:

   mvn dependency:resolve dependency:sources

which will get the jars/sources used in the .classpath from SVN.
It assumes you have M2_REPO set correctly.

== Rebuild the classpath

This should not be necessary as a .classpath is checked into SVN but:
  mvn eclipse:eclipse \
      -DdownloadSources=true \
      -DdownloadJavadoc=false \
      -DbuildOutputDirectory=classes

then put back the src-dev source folder (code that is used for development
but is not part of the artifact itself e.g. current work items, bug
reports, ....). This sets the IDE output to "classes/" (this keep maven
builds separate from code development).

== Fix svn

If you find problems with missing classes after SVN update or checkout, it
might be because of clien t problems between versions. Try:

svn update --set-depth infinity

and see if that fixes it.
