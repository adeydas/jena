ARQ is a query processor for Jena that implements SPARQL.

==== Announcing ARQ 2.0 beta

This is the first, and hopefully only, beta release of ARQ 2.0.
It is functionally a complete implementation of SPARQL including
support for custom filter function, property functions and
free text search.

There are changes to the correct results from SPARQL queries in
this release to reflectthe new SPARQL algebra:

+ {} form scoping delimiters for filter.
  + { FILTER(?v > 3) :z : p ?v } is the same as 
     { :z : p ?v FILTER(?v > 3) }
  + Variables outsoide the group are no in scope.
    Any extraneous {} around FILTERs may cause different results.
  + Results from corner cases of doubly nested OPTIONALs change.

The purpose of this beta release is to ensure migration costs from
ARQ 1.5.1 to ARQ 2.0 are as low as possible.  Please report any 
differences in behaviour, both functional and performance.

ARQ 2.0 provides the same external API as ARQ 1.5.  Internally, query
execution follows the SPARQL algebra, in development by the RDF Data
Access Working Group.  Several query engines are available:


 + Main query engine for optimization and efficient execution
 + Reference engine for checking functionality
    (implements the SPARQL evaluation semantics very simply for clarity
     and validation)
  + Remote access engine for querying SPARQL endpoints over HTTP.
  + The query engine from ARQ1, for exact ARQ1 semantics and to assist
    in migration (deprecated for new applications, it and will be removed
    sometime
  + RDQL engine
  
Internally, there has been significant reorganisation and renaming
to align with termininology of the SPARQL specification.

ARQ can also be used just SPARQL parsers, as a SPARQL algebra generator
or for spoecialised query engines.

Not in ARQ 2.0:
Extensions beyond the SPARQL syntax: UNSAID and EXT. 
OPTIONAL/!bound queries are support.
