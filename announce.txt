ARQ is a query processor for Jena that implements SPARQL.

==== Announcing ARQ 2.0 beta

This is the first, and hopefully only, beta release of ARQ 2.0.

ARQ 2.0 is a complete implementation of SPARQL including
support for custom filter function, property functions
and free text search.

ARQ 2.0 provides the same external API as ARQ 1.5.  Internally,
query execution follows the SPARQL algebra, in development by
the RDF Data Access Working Group.  There has been significant
reorganisation and renaming of implementation code to align with
termininology of the SPARQL specification.

Please report any differences in behaviour, both functional
and performance.

ARQ is also available via anonymous SVN:

SPARQL is described in:
  http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/

== Changes to SPARQL

There are changes to the correct results from SPARQL queries in
this release to reflect the new SPARQL algebra:

+ {} form scoping delimiters
  + { FILTER(?v > 3) :z : p ?v } is the same as 
     { :z : p ?v FILTER(?v > 3) }
    { :z : p ?v { FILTER (?v > 3) } } 
  + Variables outside the group are not in scope.
    { :z : p ?v { FILTER (?v > 3) } } has no solutions.
    Any extraneous {} around FILTERs may cause different results.
  + Results from corner cases of doubly nested OPTIONALs change.
  
== Changes to applications
  
The function library and property function libary have both moved:
The correct base URIs are now:
    Functions: http://jena.hpl.hp.com/ARQ/function#
    Property functions: http://jena.hpl.hp.com/ARQ/property#

These are the perferred prefix URIs.

The code now resides in packages "com.hp.hpl.jena.sparql.function.library" and
"com.hp.hpl.jena.sparql.pfunction.library".  Old URIs using the old package
name and "java:" should work because there is a redirection left in-place.

== Status

The implementation of SPARQL is complete and meets the
SPARQL current editors' working draft and cuurently planned
Last Call design.

== Notes

Several query engines are available:

 + Main query engine for optimization and efficient execution
 + Reference engine for checking functionality
    (implements the SPARQL evaluation semantics very simply for clarity
     and validation)
  + Remote access engine for querying SPARQL endpoints over HTTP.
  + The query engine from ARQ1, for exact ARQ1 semantics and to assist
    in migration (deprecated for new applications, it and will be removed
    sometime
  + RDQL engine
 
ARQ can also be used just as a SPARQL parser, as a SPARQL algebra
generator or as a basis for specialised query engines.

Not in ARQ 2.0:

Extensions beyond the SPARQL syntax: UNSAID and EXT. 
OPTIONAL/!bound queries are support.
