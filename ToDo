==== ARQ ToDo

++ ** Document "stages"
++ ** Document "update API"
-----

+ DatasetImpl and DataSourceImpl 
    Revisit.
      
+ DateTime arithmetic and durations
  http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/#dateTime-arithmetic

+ Aggregates
  QueryIterGroup
  Parsing : 
     SELECT list is expressions always (inv vars)
     Ordered Map [LinkedHashMap?] from name (generated if necessary) to expression.
     Phase 2 detects inconsistences 
         
+ Quads - independent quads?  Or retain blocking structure?

+ Remote update over HTTP

+ Improvements - are these measurable?
  If a stage generates no new bindings, don't allocation a BindingMap unnecessarility.

+ OpDiff : Test ref and QueryIterDiff

== Core

+ What is "OpDatasetNames" nowadays?
	A table?  unnecessary?
+ Revisit arq.cmd.QueryUtils for printing.

+ Alternative indexes
  LARQ idea - extracted.  Object ==> node/subject
  
+ REDUCED tests :-(

+ Serilization: 
    redo "prefix" to be SSE compatible.

+ Property function to property path expression

+ testing QE1 and QE2 and QE3 in the same test run

+ Commands
  + qtest to use modules (and qexpr)
    ModVersion

== Algebra

+ OpWalker - only used for getting vars, and that needs to truncate a walk.
+ Left join as "join union diff"
+ Table equals (with and without order)
+ Binding equals
  
== LARQ

+ LARQ assembler

+ LARQ Doc internals
  Fields: index, lex/lang/datatype, uri, bnode

== Documentation

+ list handling as a specific page.
  + Internals
  	Query iterators
  	Bindings

+ Writing filter functions [Done]
+ Writing property functions

+ Document making and using datasets
+ Location-mapping and FROM/FROM NAMED
  
== Other

+ XML results: process xml:lang on other elements than just <literal>
  Documentation for XML result set processing
