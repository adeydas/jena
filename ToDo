SDB ToDo list (and general notes)
=================================

+ Bug: unmentioned var in FILTER regex => NPE

+ Non-project var is off-ramped in ex1a.rq ??
  Note where this is done.
  
+ "Proper order" for BGPs, and better SDB handling of whole BGP

+ Use SQL COALESCE for OPTIONALs with shared variables

+ Subquery scoping enhancements

+ Config loader
    sdbmetaload --sdb sdb.ttl --name=<name> FILE
    sdbmetadump --sdb sdb.ttl --name=<name>
  or
    sdbconfig --load --name=<name> FILE
  

SqlExpr::
IJ-R-T => IJ(r)-T is done specially - make a special stage (RA optimizer?)
OR improve the generation of SQL output and leave the tree much as is.
OR canonical tree SPJ

Need to worrry more about varibale definedness in PlanSDB generation

HSQL/MySQL joint testing

== Next
  4/ ==> Performance testing

+ Connection + Layout = Store?
  Layout is in Store config?

+ sdprint, sdbquery : ModSDB? for printing queries, blocks, RelAlg and SQL?
  Are these two commands nearly the same? ytes - if dummy connection.



c.f. SQLCache and returning prepared statements
  Named parameters in INSERT for robustness.
  Sequences, not autoIncrement

Encode upper/lower case into SQL identifiers.
  SQLidAllocate(String) => String
  SPARQLid2SQLid and reverse
    Off ramp only needed => not needed at all but eaier to see what's going on
    
Need to handle connection management to be concurrency and connection pooling friendly.

+ Test for 
   + FILTER and out-of-block variables ; OPTIONAL { FILTER (?x = .. ) ?x :p ?q }
   + Nested optionals with var not used by outer one (bottom up/top down issue)
   + Two optionals with a shared var
