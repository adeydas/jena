==== ARQ ToDo

ARQ2-beta
+ ** Document "stages"

-----

== Core

+ Alternative indexes
  LARQ idea - extracted.
  
+ LARQ  
  IndexLARQ : searchModelByIndex - access to limits and score.
    - return HitLARQs.
  Contains - no subject score.
  

+ REDUCED tests :-(

+ Regex(xsd:string,)

+ Serilization: 
    redo "prefix" to be SSE compatible.
    op: triples/quads as lists themselves (+builder)
    op: builder for modifier

+ ref.Eval - tidy up
  
  + Very simple, non-streaming table usage.
    No iterators.
    TableSimple is the only streaming point - and often materialized.
    And used via TableFactory.create(QueryIterator) as well as direct
  + Only one evaluator?

+ Property function to property path expression

+ Non-distinguished variable removal.
   StageBuilder - strict place
   In a project (or pseudo project) - does it once.
      Need test case : { _:a :p ?v. ?v :splitIRI (?ns ?ln) . _a :p ?w } 
      
+  strictMode - use in ref engine?

+ testing QE1 and QE2 and QE3 in the same test run

+ Commands
  + qtest to use modules (and qexpr)
    ModVersion
