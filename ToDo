ARQ2-beta
+ ** Document "stages"

-----

== Core

+ Check "=" is an error when unknown.

+ Serilization: 
    redo "prefix" to be SSE compatible.
    op: triples/quads as lists themselves (+builder)
    op: builder for modifier

+ ref.Eval - tidy up
  
  + Very simple, non-streaming table usage.
    No iterators.
    TableSimple is the only streaming point - and often materialized.
    And used via TableFactory.create(QueryIterator) as well as direct
  + Only one evaluator?

+ Property function to property path expression

+ Non-distinguished variable removal.
   StageBuilder - strict place
   In a project (or pseudo project) - does it once.
      Need test case : { _:a :p ?v. ?v :splitIRI (?ns ?ln) . _a :p ?w } 
      
+  strictMode - use in ref engine?

+ testing QE1 and QE2 and QE3 in the same test run

+ Commands
  + qtest to use modules (and qexpr)

== LARQ

+ LARQ assembler

+ Access to other fields
  e.g. +((text:(foo bar)^2)(title:(foo bar)^4)(description:(foo bar)^3))
  Use cases and examples?

+ Extend to: (?node ?score) textMatch ('query' 100) 
  Also ARQ.luceneLimit context parameter

+ Doc internals
  Fields: index, lex/lang/datatype, uri, bnode

== Documentation

+ Document list handling as a specific page.
  + Internals
  	Query iterators
  	Bindings

+ Writing filter functions
+ Writing property functions

+ Document making and using datasets
+ Location-mapping and FROM/FROM NAMED
  
== Core
