==== ARQ ToDo

++ ** Document "stages"
++ ** Document "update API"
-----

OpService

+ Move ResultSetRewindable into the "query" package 
  Leave a toolstone in sparql.ResultSetRewindable
  Add to FAQ

+ DateTime arithmetic and durations
  http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/#dateTime-arithmetic

+ Aggregates: QueryIterGroup
  Parsing : 
     SELECT list is expressions always (inv vars)
     Ordered Map [LinkedHashMap?] from name (generated if necessary) to expression.
     Phase 2 detects inconsistences 
         
+ Quads - independent quads?  Or retain blocking structure?

+ Remote update over HTTP

+ testing QE/ref and QE/main in the same run
  ?? use a factory list, including tests with no recorded results.
  ?? Could simply factory to have .create() return null for "no".

== Core

+ What is "OpDatasetNames" nowadays?
	A table?  unnecessary?
+ Revisit arq.cmd.QueryUtils for printing.

+ Alternative indexes
  LARQ idea - extracted.  Object ==> node/subject
  
+ REDUCED tests :-(

+ Commands
  + qtest to use modules (and qexpr)
    ModVersion

+ DatasetImpl and DataSourceImpl 
    Revisit.
      
== Algebra

+ OpWalker - only used for getting vars, and that needs to truncate a walk.
+ Left join as "join union diff"
+ Table equals (with and without order)
  
== LARQ

+ LARQ assembler

+ LARQ Doc internals
  Fields: index, lex/lang/datatype, uri, bnode

== Documentation

+ list handling as a specific page.
  + Internals
  	Query iterators
  	Bindings

+ Writing filter functions [Done]
+ Writing property functions

+ Document making and using datasets
+ Location-mapping and FROM/FROM NAMED
  
== Other

+ XML results: process xml:lang on other elements than just <literal>
  Documentation for XML result set processing
