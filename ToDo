SDB ToDo list (and general notes)
=================================

+ String value table
   With no URIs, much shorter.
   Full text indexing where available

+ "Proper order" for BGPs, and better SDB handling of whole BGP

+ Use SQL COALESCE for OPTIONALs with shared variables

+ Subquery scoping enhancements

+ Config loader
    sdbmetaload --sdb sdb.ttl --name=<name> FILE
    sdbmetadump --sdb sdb.ttl --name=<name>
  or
    sdbconfig --load --name=<name> FILE
  

SqlExpr::
IJ-R-T => IJ(r)-T is done specially - make a special stage (RA optimizer?)
OR improve the generation of SQL output and leave the tree much as is.
OR canonical tree SPJ

HSQL/MySQL joint testing

== Next
  4/ ==> Performance testing


c.f. SQLCache and returning prepared statements
  Named parameters in INSERT for robustness.
  Sequences, not autoIncrement

Encode upper/lower case into SQL identifiers.
  SQLidAllocate(String) => String
  SPARQLid2SQLid and reverse
    Off ramp only needed => not needed at all but eaier to see what's going on
    
Need to handle connection management to be concurrency and connection pooling friendly.

+ Test for 
   + FILTER and out-of-block variables ; OPTIONAL { FILTER (?x = .. ) ?x :p ?q }
   + Nested optionals with var not used by outer one (bottom up/top down issue)
   + Two optionals with a shared var
