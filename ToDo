SDB ToDo list (and general notes)
=================================

SqlExpr::
IJ-R-T => IJ(r)-T is done specially - make a special stage (RA optimizer?)
OR improve the generation of SQL output and leave the tree much as is.
OR canonical tree SPJ

HSQL/MySQL joint testing

DRYing out:
QC1 and Q2 match/processSlot have much in common.
  QC_Slot?

== Next
  4/ ==> Performance testing

+ Connection + Layout = Store?

+ sdprint, sdbquery : ModSDB? for printing queries, blocks, RelAlg and SQL?
  Are these two commands nearl the same? No - sdbprint does not need --sdb

+ Use SQL COALESCE for OPTIONALs with shared variables

c.f. SQLCache and returning prepared statements
  Named parameters in INSERT for robustness.
  Sequences, not autoIncrement

Encode upper/lower case into SQL identifiers.
  SQLidAllocate(String) => String
  SPARQLid2SQLid and reverse
    Off ramp only needed => not needed at all but eaier to see what's going on
    
Need to handle connection management to be concurrency and connection pooling friendly.

+ Test for 
   + FILTER and out-of-block variables ; OPTIONAL { FILTER (?x = .. ) ?x :p ?q }
   + Nested optionals with var not used by outer one (bottom up/top down issue)
   + Two optionals with a shared var
