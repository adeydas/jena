==Investigating what is going on==

TDB can optionally log query execution details.  This is controlled by two setting: the logging level and a context setting.  Having two setting means it is possible to log some queries and not others.

The logger used is called <code>com.hp.hpl.jena.tdb.exec</code>. Message are sent at level "info".  So for log4j, the following can be set in the log4j.properties file:

 log4j.logger.com.hp.hpl.jena.tdb.exec=INFO

The context setting is for key (Java constant) <code>TDB.symLogExec</code>.  To set globally:

 TDB.getContext().set(TDB.symLogExec,true) ;

and it may also be set on an individual query execution using it's local context.
  
  QueryExecutiuon qExec = QueryExecutionFactory.create(...) ;
  qExec.getContext().set(TDB.symLogExec,true) ;

On the command lie:

  tdbquery --set tdb:logExec=true --file <i>queryfile</i>
