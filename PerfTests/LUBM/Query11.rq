# - Query 11, 12 and 13 are intended to verify the presence of certain reasoning capabilities in the system. In this query, property subOrganizationOf is defined as transitive. Since in the benchmark data, instances of ResearchGroup are stated as a sub-organization of a Department individual and the later suborganization of a University individual, inference about the subOrgnizationOf relationship between instances of ResearchGroup and University is required to answer this query. Additionally, its input is small.
