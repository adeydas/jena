ChangeLog for TDB
=================

==== 0.8.0

+ Upgrade to Java5 version of ARQ.

==== 0.7.2

Bug fixes:

- The comand line tools did not work with a location and a named graph.

- removeAll(s,p,o) added.  Improve Model.removeAll()

==== 0.7.1

Bug fixes:

- Dataset.containsNamedModel on a TDB-backed data store always returns false.
  Now returns true if there are any triples in that graph.
  
- removeAll could cause an exception.
  Known issue but could manifest itself in strange ways
  Temporary fix applied - functionally correct but may use significant amounts of memory.
  
- Persistent prefixes might not work with RDF/XML even if they did for other formats.
  Fixed. 
   
==== 0.7.0

+ Named graph support
  Native TDB support for RDF datasets, including a quads table.
  Preliminary.

+ Reification: Support for Reification style "standard" 

+ Upgrade to slf4j 1.5.6 (2 jar names change)

==== 0.6.0

+ Added optimizer (statistics based) 
+ (32 bit OS) Added a transaction handler that will cause cached changes
  to be flushed to disk.  This is not ACID semantics and no abort is possible.   

==== 0.5.3

+ Bug fixes: concurrency control for on-disk files
