Build:

Run
   PatternCompiler.main (writes host.jflex)
then run
   AbsLexer.main, 
then refresh in Eclipse.

See AFS_Build
(JFlex 1.4.3)
  PatternCompiler.main(args) ;
  AbsLexer.main(args) ;
  // Now refresh and rebuild.
  // Need to edit result to remove "private" from yytext in each subparser

[[
RFC 1123, sec 2.1

      The syntax of a legal Internet host name was specified in RFC-952
      [DNS:4].  One aspect of host name syntax is hereby changed: the
      restriction on the first character is relaxed to allow either a
      letter or a digit.  Host software MUST support this more liberal
      syntax.
]]

I can't find an updated official grammar and I only came across by googling
to get the authoritive text to show it was illegal.  I happened on a nice
web page of DNS standards which mentioned it.

RFC 3986, sec 3.2.2, talks about the ambiguity.

The 1123 text isn't entirely clear - does it mean the first char of the
whole DNS host name or every component?

So a host of "1752" is now legal (albeit silly and unlikely to work very well).

IP_V4_OCTET_RANGE
IP_V4_HAS_FOUR_COMPONENTS 
are no longer MUST
