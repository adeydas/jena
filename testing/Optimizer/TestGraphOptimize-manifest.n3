					 At no stage, there should be a triple pattern which introduces only new variables and, thus, cannot
					 be joined with the previous triple patterns. The :s3 join is the most selectivite, thus, it is executed
					 first. The pattern with subject :s1 is executed last, because at the third position it would not be
					 joined with the previous patterns." ;
