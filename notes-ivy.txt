Either version is  "working@Seaborne3" in ivy:publish, and ivy:resolve
defaults

Else

add to ivy:resolve force to tdb-0.0.-dev
(then evicts items from 

?? set org etc in some file somewhere 

-- 
revision on ivy-module->info->revision="${version}"
Stops evictions (why?)
  Transitivity?
---
Why 
ivy:publish conf="main" 
		 organisation="com.hp.hpl.jena" module="tdb"
		 revision="${version}"

why evicting when ivy:resolve  (no revision on info) Transitivity?
why does ivy:resolve and ivy:publish need revisions?

What are the default settings names?
