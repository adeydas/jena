defaults

Else

add to ivy:resolve force to tdb-0.0.-dev
(then evicts items from 

?? set org etc in some file somewhere

Why 
ivy:publish conf="main" 
		 organisation="com.hp.hpl.jena" module="tdb"
		 revision="${version}"

why evicting when ivy:resolve 
whu does ivy:resolve and ivy:publish need revisions?
