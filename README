                                  ===========

  Jena is a Java framework for building semantic web applications. It provides 
  tools and Java libraries to help you to develop semantic web and linked-data 
  apps, tools and servers.

  This distribution includes the following Apache Jena modules: 

  - jena-core ..... https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jena/Jena2/jena/
    this module provides the Jena RDF APIs, Ontology APIs and Infrence APIs. 
  - jena-iri ....... https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jena/Jena2/IRI/
    this module provides an implementation of RFC 3987 (IRI) and RFC 3986 (URI)
  - jena-arq ....... https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jena/Jena2/ARQ/
    this module provides the SPARQL query engine used by Jena

  Installing Jena
  ---------------

  Jena is a Java library for RDF and OWL. To use Jena in your application, 
  ensure all the .jar files in the lib/ directory are on the classpath or 
  available to your web application. Jena is tested with these .jar files,
  it includes a copy of Apache Xerces and it relies on specific features 
  that change between versions.
