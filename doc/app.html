<h1>SDB - Use with Java Applications</h1>
<p>SDB presents the Jena model and query APIs. To use SDB, the application 
should call <code>SDB.init()</code>. In fact, this is often unnecessary because 
all the API classes automatically check for initialization and it is only 
necessary if directly using assembler descriptions for SDB resources, not using 
the factory operations that make this more convenient. </p>
<ol>
  <li><code>SDB.init()</code> - wires in the assembler support and wires in the 
  SPARQL query engine for SDB.</li>
  <li>Create a dataset from <code>SDBFactory</code>.</li>
  <li>Use a dataset/model/graph as normal, including loading data, API access 
  and SPARQL query.</li>
</ol>
<p>When wired into the ARQ query engine registry, queries on SDB datasets, API 
calls to SDB models go to SDB; nothing different needs to be done by teh 
application, including for the bulk loading of data&nbsp; All other queries 
proceed as normal to the standard ARQ query system.</p>
<p>There are <a href="cmds.html">command line applications</a> to format, load 
and query an SDB store.</p>
