==== SSE

+ Literals and @
  Include @ into literal terminator 
  Currently, symbols can't start with a @ or ^ 

+ Reader-writer tests

+ OpAssign
  Make assignment property functions generate an opAssign.

+ test another form -- (debug FOO)

+ Expr: (exists (pattern ...))
  Tidy expr writing - consolidate in WriterExpr
  
+ SSE.parseXXX(, Prologue)

+ FmtUtils - Base URI abbreviation
  See _stringForURI

+ Writing.
  Need an architecture.
    Template:
    WriterXXX.output(IndentWriter, T, SerializationContext)
    
  
  Output: bundle
    IndentedWriter, Prologue, BNode map
    Prologue+BNodemap => SerializationContext
      rename SerializationContext => NameContext    

   Transfer FmtExprPrefix
     WriterExpr to include ExprList
   Remove OpWriter - (or stub)
   ExprUtils.fmtPrefix => WriterExpr.out(Expr), .out(ExprList)
