==== SSE

+ Literals and @
  Include @ into literal terminator 
  Currently, symbols can't start with a @ or ^ 

+ Reader-writer tests

+ OpAssign
  Make assignment property functions generate an opAssign.

+ test another form -- (debug FOO)

+ Expr: (exists (pattern ...))
  Tidy expr writing - consolidate in WriterExpr
  
+ SSE.parseXXX(, Prologue)

+ FmtUtils - Base URI abbreviation
  See _stringForURI

+ Writing.
  Need an architecture.
  
  writer.WriterX does not add (base (prefix ...)) - it is the nested code
  WriterSSE.out(...) is the top level call. 
   Extract - hardwired to use for Op.  Now Graph, Dataset, ...
    WriterBasePrefix.out(iWriter, new WriterFOO(), prologue) 
  WriterFOO implements Format { void format() ; }
